### PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS FOUND AND UNCAUGHT EXCEPTIONS TO dangar13@ucm.es OR POST THEM AT THE ISSUES TAB.

#### Alpha v1.0:
> It is already possible to play a 1 vs 1 match for two human players on the same computer, following the rules.

- Clicking on the edge of a cell will make the program believe that the user clicked outside the cell, on a adjacent one. This will not cause any uncaught exception since the game already takes into account that the position must be valid. However, it could cause confusion to the user. This will be fixed in a later version.
- It is more than likely that most the side panel buttons for the game won't work. Some functions have not been implemented yet.
