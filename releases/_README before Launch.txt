All of the versions here contained are likely to have errors, bugs and/or limited capabilities. This is only an Alpha version of the software, therefore, it should only be used for testing purposes.

To run the program from any other path outside the cloned repository, the folder "img" needs to be on the same folder as the JAR file to be executed.

"java -jar [full-path-to-file]"
