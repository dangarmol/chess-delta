# Disclaimer

All of the versions here contained are likely to have errors, bugs and/or limited capabilities.
This is only an Alpha version of the software, and should therefore only be used for testing purposes.

To run the program from any other path outside the cloned repository, the folder [img](/releases/img) needs to be on the same folder as the JAR file to be executed.

You will also need to have the latest version of Java installed in your machine.

#### To properly launch the software and be able to see uncaught exceptions, it should never be run by double-clicking the JAR file, instead, you should be using the following console command:
`java -jar [full-path-to-file]`
