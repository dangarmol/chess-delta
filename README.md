# Chess
BSc Software Engineering Project by Daniel Garc√≠a Molero.

To try the latest release, go to the folder [**releases**](/releases) and launch the JAR file after reading the documentation inside said folder.

### Chess Project Checklist: <br>
- [x] Data Structures Design.<br>
- [x] GUI Creation.<br>
- [x] Creation of the Chess Move algorithms (to avoid illegal moves).<br>
- [x] Creation of the Chess Rules (when a game ends with a winner or in a draw).<br>
- [x] Creation of a list of possible moves (to implement Artificial Intelligence).<br>
- [ ] Dummy player implementation that performs a random (but legal) move.<br>
- [ ] Min-Max AI implementation.<br>
- [ ] Neg-Max AI implementation.<br>
- [ ] Alpha-Beta AI implementation.<br>
- [ ] MCTS AI implementation (MonteCarlo Tree Search).<br>
- [ ] Online version of the game.<br>
- [ ] Neural Networks approach to AI (Research).<br>
- [ ] Distributed Computing (to make the game server run on an actual server instead of one of the players' machines).<br>
- [ ] Responsive Web and/or iOS / Android App.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: Not every element on the list will be added to the final version of the game. This is only an optimistic approach to the features that could be implemented in case that there is enough time for it.
